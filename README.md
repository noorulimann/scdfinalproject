# 🛍️ Levis – Online Shopping Web Application

Levis is a full-stack e-commerce application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). The platform allows users to browse, search, and purchase clothes and other products online. It includes secure authentication, dynamic product listings, role-based access (Admin/Customer), and full Docker support for simplified development and deployment.
